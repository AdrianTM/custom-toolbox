Custom Toolbox is a utility used for building custom launchers (toolboxes) by editing a simple text file (.list extension).
The default location of the .list files is /etc/custom-toolbar but the files can be placed in any folder. 
You can build multiple launchers using different .list files.
<p>
<b>Structure of .list file</b> (you can find an example in /etc/custom-toolbar)<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
# Comments that start with # are ignored<br>
# Simple text file containing Name= Comment= Category= keywords<br>
# with the list of app names under each coresponding category<br>
# optional "root" flag can follow app name to indicate how to run the app<br>
<p>
Name=Name of the Launcher<br>
Comment=This is a comment/description for the launcher<br>
<p>
Category=Name of the category<br>
app1<br>
app2 root<br>
app3<br>
<p>
Category=Second category<br>
app4 root<br>
app5<br>

----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
In this example app2 and app4 run as root, the other are launched as normal user. 
<b>Only apps that have a corresponding .desktop file show up in the custom launcher.</b>
<p>
You can launch the app directly with the "custom-toolbar filename.list" command or you can browse the .list file 
from the application.
<p>
You can select "Show this dialog at startup" checkbox to diplay the custom launcher at startup. That will place a .desktop file in ~/.custom/autostart with the name that appears in Name= field in the .list file. 
You can manualy copy that .desktop file to /usr/share/applications if you want to place it in your menu. 
In Xfce, in order to see the change, you need to run the command "xfce4-panel -r" as normal user.
